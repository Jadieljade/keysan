        <h1>Merge of two souls</h1>
        <p>
          In a realm where time stands still,<br />
          Two souls destined, their hearts to fill,<br />
          After years apart, a void to thrill,<br />
          In the dance of fate, they twirl with entwined will.<br /><br />

          Underneath the velvet sky's embrace,<br />
          Their longing hearts, a fervent chase,<br />
          In the echo of their love's embrace,<br />
          Time surrenders, in this enchanted space.<br /><br />

          Across the distance, their souls entwine,<br />
          In the symphony of love's design,<br />
          Through trials and tribulations, they shine,<br />
          In the tapestry of fate, their love align.<br /><br />

          With every step, the distance fades,<br />
          In each other's arms, their love cascades,<br />
          In whispered promises, beneath the shades,<br />
          Of love's sanctuary, where dreams pervade.<br /><br />

          And as the stars above disclose,<br />
          Their love story, in twilight's prose,<br />
          Hand in hand, they find repose,<br />
          In love's haven, where affection flows.<br /><br />

          They danced beneath the moon's soft light,<br />
          In the realm of love, pure and bright,<br />
          In each other's arms, they found respite,<br />
          And they twirled in a field of roses, a beautiful sight.<br /><br />

          Petals kissed by the gentle breeze,<br />
          Whispers of love, carried with ease,<br />
          Their hearts entwined, a symphony of pleas,<br />
          In this moment, time unfreezes.<br /><br />

          The fragrance of love, intoxicatingly sweet,<br />
          In the embrace of passion, their souls meet,<br />
          In the garden of love, where lovers greet,<br />
          Their love story, an eternal feat.<br /><br />

          Through the meadows, they wandered on,<br />
          In love's embrace, they felt reborn,<br />
          With every step, a new dawn,<br />
          In each other's arms, forever sworn.<br /><br />

          They whispered vows amid the roses' bloom,<br />
          In the sanctuary of love's perfume,<br />
          In the silent night, love's sacred room,<br />
          Their love, a treasure to consume.<br /><br />

          And as the dawn paints the sky anew,<br />
          Their love, like roses, forever true,<br />
          In each other's arms, they knew,<br />
          Their love story, forever in view.<br />
